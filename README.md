## Java-scanner For the Language, TinyOne
A compiler is consist of **frontend** and **backend**.
In the frontend of the compiler, there are *Parser* and *Scanner*.
First of all, **Scanner** does a lexical analysis. 
Lexical anlysis, lexing or tokenization is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens.

**Parser** analyze the syntax of codes.

**Java-Scanner for TinyOne** is a program that generate tokens through lexical analyzing toward language *TinyOne*(actually this TinyOne language is virtual, and only for test langauge.)
Tokens, generated by Scanner, is used to analyze the syntax by Parser.
